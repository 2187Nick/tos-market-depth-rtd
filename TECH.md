# Dive deeper into level 2 data

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a82789f-4fbe-4906-b34d-0823608c6fc4

Through RTD(or DDE) I am only able to get data from some exchanges.

Example:
```=DDE("TOS","LAST_SIZE",".SPY250417C555)```

You can see the Total Volume(Red box) and Exchange Volume(Green box)

Why doesnt the Total exchange volume == Total volume?

Some trades are transacted outside of the exchanges listed? Why doesnt TOS list them?

The exchanges available in RTD are the same as we can see in Level 2 field in TOS.
